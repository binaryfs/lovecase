### Added

- The new assertion methods `TestSet:assertSame` and `TestSet:assertNotSame` use `rawequal` for comparison

- `TestSet:assertEqual` and `TestSet:assertNotEqual` perform a simple table comparison if no custom equality function exists and the __eq metamethod is not applicable
- `TestSet:assertAlmostEqual` and `TestSet:assertNotAlmostEqual` compare numbers with a tolerance, to allow a larger margin of error when comparing floating point numbers
- Serialize tables in assertion errors if no `__tostring` metamethod exists
- Relational assertion methods: `assertSmallerThan`, `assertSmallerThanEqual`, `assertGreaterThan` and `assertGreaterThanEqual`
- `TestReport:isFailed` checks if at least one test in a set failed (backported from roguelove)
